# Maverick

.NET / C# script to close software that contain social aspects in them. Ones like Discord, Steam, Slack etc.

## Build the executable

`dotnet publish src -o dist`

## Motivation

Sometimes you'd just prefer to close them all in one click without thinking about the two dozen subprograms and processes they have started. Or feel the need to see if they're still running in background and giving your contacts the false impression that you're available online.

## Whats in the name?

From Merriam-Webster dictionary: *maverick is an independent individual who does not go along with a group or party.*
